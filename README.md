## What is this madness?

Well, it's some kind of starting point for a project, where you are basically starting from square one. Hence the name üòâ

## Goodies

You may ask "What's in the Box?" and here are some insufficient answers:

- `.vscode` settings and extension suggentions to get yu started
- `webpack` config for processing `scss`, `twig`, `js` and various assets
  - *assets:* `svg` sprite generator
- a solid `scss` starter which is split
- code quality galore: `stylelint`, `eslint`
- `twig` is templating language of choice ( easier integration in Sylius and Grav, plus it has pretty low frustration potential )

All those components are highly customizable, because nothing is hidden away. So explore its contents make it your own ‚òùÔ∏è.
